I would like to create a personal static website.  I would like this website to include the following sections:

- a main homepage that serves as an introduction to me-- a modern business card of sorts.  
- a section for my work history / experience.  
- a blog section.  This should include landing page that allows for navigation to the rest of my blog articles.  I would like this to include filtering abilities
based on frontmatter tags
- a "Things I Like" section. The goal of this section is just to centralize a place for things like "Top 5 Books","Top 5 Albums", etc. A sort of non-work way of
getting to know me. 

From a technical perspective, I would like to use a somewhat simple static site generator.  Ive looked at zola and zine and kinda liked both.  The important
part to me is that I can write and maintain the content in markdown. Its also important to me that I have good language aware syntax highlighting in code blocks. 


From a visual perspective, I'd like it to look a bit like 
https://matklad.github.io/
https://www.dbreunig.com/
https://kristoff.it/

I really like the everforest colorscheme.  https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest.  I would like a light and dark mode for my website, as well as an easy file
to edit the colorscheme later.  BUt for now I'd like to use everforest dark and light. 


I'll fill my content later, but generate filler text for the blogs and pages for now to get a feel for site navigation
