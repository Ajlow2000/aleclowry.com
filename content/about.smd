# About Me

Hi, I'm Alec Lowry, a software engineer passionate about creating reliable, scalable systems that solve real problems.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on:

- **Backend Systems**: Designing and implementing distributed architectures, APIs, and microservices
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Working with AWS, containerization, and deployment pipelines
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing applications for speed, scalability, and resource efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Building tools and processes that make development teams more productive

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time. I'm always learning new technologies and methodologies, but I value choosing the right tool for the job over chasing the latest trends.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not programming, I enjoy exploring new places, reading about technology and business, and experimenting with side projects that combine my interests in software and creativity.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss technology, collaborate on projects, or just chat about software engineering.
