# Hi, I'm Alec Lowry

I'm a software engineer passionate about building elegant solutions to complex problems. I enjoy working across the full stack, from low-level systems programming to user-facing applications.

This site is my digital garden—a place where I share what I'm learning, working on, and thinking about. You'll find technical posts about programming, reflections on software engineering practices, and glimpses into the things that inspire me outside of work.

When I'm not coding, you might find me reading, exploring new music, or tinkering with side projects that probably won't see the light of day (but teach me something valuable anyway).

Feel free to explore my [blog](/blog), check out my [experience](/experience), or see what [things I like](/things-i-like).
