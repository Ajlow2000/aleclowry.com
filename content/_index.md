# Hi, I'm Alec Lowry

I'm a software engineer passionate about achieving a deep understanding of the things I work with and building resilient, predictable software.
I enjoy working at the application and lower level of most software stacks-- with a particular emphasis on Linux and typed languages like Rust, and C/C++.
