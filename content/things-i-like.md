# Things I Like

A collection of books, music, tools, and other things that have influenced me or that I just really enjoy. Consider this a living document—I'll update it as I discover new favorites.

## Books

### Fiction
- **The Name of the Wind** by Patrick Rothfuss
  *Beautiful prose and a magic system that feels almost scientific. Still waiting for book three...*

- **Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir
  *A love letter to problem-solving and the scientific method, wrapped in a page-turner of a story.*

- **The Dispossessed** by Ursula K. Le Guin
  *Thoughtful exploration of anarchism vs. capitalism told through compelling characters.*

### Non-Fiction
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann
  *The best book on distributed systems and databases I've read. Dense but incredibly valuable.*

- **A Philosophy of Software Design** by John Ousterhout
  *Short, opinionated, and full of wisdom about managing complexity in software.*

- **The Pragmatic Programmer** by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt
  *Classic for a reason. Advice that stays relevant regardless of which language you're using.*

## Music

### Albums I Keep Coming Back To
- **In Rainbows** by Radiohead
  *Perfect from start to finish. "Weird Fishes" is a masterpiece.*

- **Currents** by Tame Impala
  *Synth-heavy psychedelic pop that's impossible not to groove to.*

- **Illinois** by Sufjan Stevens
  *Ambitious, orchestral, and surprisingly emotional for an album about a state.*

- **Random Access Memories** by Daft Punk
  *A beautiful swan song. "Touch" makes me emotional every time.*

## Tools & Software

### Editor
- **Neovim** with LazyVim
  *The learning curve is real, but the payoff in productivity and customization is worth it.*

### Terminal
- **Alacritty** + **tmux** + **zsh**
  *Fast, minimal, and exactly as customizable as I need.*

### Languages I Enjoy
- **Rust** - Makes me think harder about my code in all the right ways
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with guardrails
- **Python** - Still the best language for getting ideas into code quickly

### Other Tools
- **ripgrep** - Searching through code at ludicrous speed
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finding everything
- **bat** - `cat` with syntax highlighting and git integration

## Podcasts
- **Oxide and Friends** - Bryan Cantrill and guests discussing systems, hardware, and tech history
- **CoRecursive** - In-depth interviews with programmers about their work
- **Song Exploder** - Musicians break down how their songs were made
