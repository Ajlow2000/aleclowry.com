# Alec Lowry

Software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems. I enjoy working across the full stack, from backend architecture to frontend experiences, with a particular interest in performance optimization and developer tooling.

Currently focused on distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and exploring the intersection of technology and user experience. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, writing about my discoveries, and sharing the things that inspire me.
